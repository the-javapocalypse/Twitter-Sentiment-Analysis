## Getting Started
 
First of all login from your Twitter account and goto [Twitter Apps](https://apps.twitter.com/). Create a new app ([How to create twitter app](http://www.letscodepro.com/twitter-sentiment-analysis/)) and goto __Keys and access tokens__ and copy Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token and Access Token Secret. We will need them later. 

### Installation

Download or Clone the repo, Navigate to the directory containing the files and run
```
python setup.py install
```
or if you have different versions of python installed then
```
python3 setup.py install 
```
to install the dependencies.


### Usage

Once you have created an app on twitter and installed all the dependencies by running __setup.py__, open main.py and paste your Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token and Access Token Secret. After that save and run the script. You will be prompted to enter the keyword/hashtag you want to analyze and the number of tweets you want to analyze. Once the analysis is completed, a pie chart will be generated disclosing the results of analysis.
